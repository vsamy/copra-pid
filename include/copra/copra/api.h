// Handle portable symbol export.
// Defining manually which symbol should be exported is required
// under Windows whether MinGW or MSVC is used.
//
// The headers then have to be able to work in two different modes:
// - dllexport when one is building the library,
// - dllimport for clients using the library.
//
// On Linux, set the visibility accordingly. If C++ symbol visibility
// is handled by the compiler, see: http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility
# if defined _WIN32 || defined __CYGWIN__
// On Microsoft Windows, use dllimport and dllexport to tag symbols.
